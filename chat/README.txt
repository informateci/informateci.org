***************************************
Welcome to the Ajax skin for FlashChat!
***************************************

YOU ARE USING AN EXPERIMENTAL, ALPHA VERSION OF THIS SOFTWARE. This version is being distributed for free to get testing assistance and feedback.

*******
INSTALL
*******

You must have FlashChat 4.7.5 or higher installed and running. You must not be using the Java or PHP socket servers. This Ajax skin only works when FlashChat is used in the default mode of operation.

STEP 1: Install FlashChat.

STEP 2: Upload all files in this folder to your FlashChat root.

Thus, if you have FlashChat installed at:

http://domain.com/chat/

You will upload these folders to:

http://domain.com/chat/templates
http://domain.com/chat/smiles
http://domain.com/chat/ajax

STEP 3: Start the Ajax chat by going to:

http://domain.com/chat/ajax/index.php

STEP 4: Start chatting!

KNOWN ISSUES
************

The following are known issues in this Ajax chat:

1) Module pack does not work

2) Some Flash interface actions, like the ability to drag and resize panes of the chat, do not work

6) Only works in Firefox and Internet Explorer for Windows. Does not work in Safari, Opera, and most other browsers.

... there may be others ... essentially, this skin is designed to work with the basic, default setup of FlashChat, but there is still a vast amount of work to get all FlashChat options working.

DEVELOPMENT PLAN
****************

November - December, 2006: Fix bugs in the alpha release.

January - February, 2007: Implement most remaining features, including socket server, config settings, and module system.

March 2007 and on: Still to be determined. Most likely, we'll start adding a lot of interesting skins, and probably javascript/html-specific features that would be difficult to implement in Flash.
